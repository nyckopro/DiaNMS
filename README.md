This project arises from the need for a simple and easy-to-administrate monitoring, and above all, to create our network designs according to our preferences and based on the powerful diagramming tool DIA . This venture has been created with the support of Informatica y Telecomunicaciones (ITC SA), which benefited from the free software and contributes to the community in this way.
